Meeting on Sunday, December 7th
--------------------------------

Goal: complete animation, equilibrium condition, entropy calculation

Present: everyone

Member        |     Role
------------- | -------------
Ben Israeli    | Zuckerberg
Chris Florencio-Aleman  | question asker
Kathleen Kennedy  | scribe
Sean Ballinger  | leader

- Sean worked on animations
- Ben worked on the order parameter
- Kathleen worked on the entropy calculation
- All discussed results

Comments on Animations
----------------------
For T = 10J it takes ~230,000 iterations to reach equilibrium
for T = 0.1J it takes ~270,000 iterations to reach eqiulibrium
This is as expected because the higher temperature makes it less likely for a spin to flip to an unfavorable value according to the Boltzmann probability which depends on the value of k*T.
